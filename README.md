# Parking_as_a_Service_Team-13

Parking as a service is a web application which allows owners to rent out their personal parking spaces or residential parking garages to people wanting to park their vehicles in popular destinations. This service aims at solving the ubiquitous problem of shortage of parking spaces. It will not only reduce vehicle circling but will also maximize parking space utilization. Parking as a Service implements an automated algorithm to surge price levels during peak hours, thereby encouraging more owners to rent out their parking space which in turn reduces traffic congestion.
